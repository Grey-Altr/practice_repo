# practice_repo

First, make a dev branch (`git checkout -b dev`)

Create and deploy a website that displays some information about you. Your HTML should include a header, a paragraph and at least one list. You should have some thoughtful CSS.

Push your work to the dev branch: `git push origin dev`

Make a pull request (PR) from a dev branch to the main branch.

When submitting, include a link to your Github Pull Request which should have Netlify deploy previews enabled.
